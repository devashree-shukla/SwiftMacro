Error Handling :

I frequently faced below errors, so I thought to share in this repo for knowledge how I fixed them.

Macro Declaration Issue As Below: I could fix it always by re checking Module & Macro type names mentioned in the Macro declaration file

Macro Test Multiline syntax issue: I could fix it by fixing syntax errors in test input & expanded output parameters or by adding a new line after starting """ in expandedOutput parameter
